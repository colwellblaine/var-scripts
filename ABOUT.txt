About the scripts here:

========================================================================

upda:

	An updated and streamlined version of something I've made in the past. the file 'initialize-upda' should automatically detect what package manager you are using. If it does not, you are probably using something else, in which case you could probably write this yourself.

========================================================================

bbdl:

	Blaine's Basic Desktop Launcher. I got tired of lightdm and its issues, so I moved to tbsm. Once tbsm started having issues (would not start dwm no matter what I did) I decided to just write my own. It's for from fully featured, and adding a new desktop must be done manually, but it's faster and less frustrating than everything else.

	It's literally just a short bash script. There's a 95% chance you could write this yourself, but why should you, when I've already done it?
